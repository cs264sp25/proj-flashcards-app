# Project Document

We are building an AI-powered Flashcards App designed to enhance the learning experience through intelligent flashcard management and AI-assisted studying. Our application will enable users to create, organize, and study flashcards efficiently, while leveraging AI capabilities to generate content and provide personalized learning assistance.

## Functional Requirements

### Primary Features (Must Have)

As a user, I want to:

1. Create an account and sign in through GitHub so I can securely access my flashcards
2. Create and organize flashcards in decks so I can structure my learning materials
3. Edit existing flashcards and decks to keep my study materials up-to-date
4. Sort, search (full-text), and filter through my flashcard collection to find specific information quickly
5. Generate AI-improved versions of my flashcard content (e.g., make text more concise, turn statements into questions)
6. Have the AI automatically generate complete flashcard decks from text inputs I provide, allowing me to quickly build comprehensive study materials without manually creating each card myself
7. Perform semantic search across flashcard collections to find related content quickly

### Secondary Features (Should Have)

As a user, I want to:

1. Write and edit flashcards in markdown format for rich text formatting
2. Track my study progress and performance to understand my learning trajectory
3. Study with an AI Learning Companion that can explain concepts in detail to enhance my understanding
4. Receive hints from the AI Learning Companion to guide me towards the correct answers
5. Get evaluation and feedback from the AI Learning Companion on my answers
6. Upload PDFs and other document formats (such as Word documents or PowerPoint presentations) to have the AI extract and transform their content into complete flashcard decks, extending beyond the basic text input capability
7. Have the AI automatically generate quizzes from my flashcard content to test my knowledge and understanding
8. Organize cards within a deck in a specific order and shuffle them during study sessions

### Tertiary Features (Nice to Have)

As a user, I want to:

1. Have Latex support for mathematical equations and symbols in flashcards
2. Edit my profile and user preferences to customize my experience working with the app
3. Extract information directly from websites by providing URLs, allowing the AI to convert online articles, blog posts, and reference pages into structured flashcard decks without manual copying and pasting
4. Tag and categorize flashcards for improved organization
5. Duplicate decks or cards to create variations or extensions
6. Listen to text-to-speech readings of my flashcards
7. Engage in audio chat with the AI Learning Companion
8. Mark difficult cards for review
9. Have a dashboard to view study statistics and insights on my learning progress and performance over time so I can track my improvement

### Won't Have Features

As a user, I want to:

1. Have support for Mermaid, PlantUML, and other diagramming tools in flashcards
2. Add images and multimedia to flashcards
3. Experience adaptive difficulty in questions in quizzes generated by the AI Learning Companion based on my performance
4. Study flashcards with spaced repetition
5. Set study reminders and goals
6. Collaborate on decks with others
7. Access a marketplace to share or sell decks of cards
8. Share decks on social media
9. Process and transcribe audio-visual content from YouTube videos, podcasts, and other multimedia sources to automatically create flashcard decks from spoken and visual information
10. Generate a podcast-style audio review from a deck of flashcards
11. Have the AI analyze my study patterns and suggest optimal review schedules
12. Export and import flashcard decks to share with others or use offline

The above features are out of scope for the initial version of the application but could be considered for future iterations.

### Tech Stack

To align with the technology stack used in the Practical Gen AI course:

### Frontend

- **Framework**: React
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS and Shadcn UI
- **State Management**: Nanostores
- **Routing**: Nanostores router libraries
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Deployment**: Netlify

### Backend

- **Backend-as-a-Service**: Convex for authentication, storage, database, vector database, and serverless functions (provides development and deployment environment)
- **AWS Lambda**: For serverless functions and backend logic that Convex doesn't support (e.g., if we must use a Python library that does not have a equivalent in TypeScript)
- **AI Integration**: Vercel's AI SDK for AI feature abstraction and orchestration (we will deliberately avoid using more complex abstractions like LangChain or LlamaIndex unless necessary)

### AI Services

- **Large Language Models**: OpenAI's GPT-4o for AI-powered editing and content generation
- **Embedding Models**: OpenAI's `text-embedding-3-small` for semantic search and similarity
- **Audio Processing**: OpenAI's text-to-speech (TTS) and speech-to-text (STT) models for audio features
- **Memory**: OpenAI's Assistant API provides memory capabilities for the AI Learning Companion
- **Tool Calling**: OpenAI's Assistant API provides tool (function) calling capabilities to create agentic AI behavior
