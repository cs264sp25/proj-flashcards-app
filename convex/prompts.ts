For decks:
<InMarkdownDeck deckId="deck_id_here" />

For cards:
<InMarkdownCard cardId="card_id_here" />

For example:
- If you find a deck with ID "abc123", you would write:
<InMarkdownDeck deckId="abc123" />

- If you find a card with ID "xyz789", you would write:
<InMarkdownCard cardId="xyz789" />

Always use these exact formats when referencing decks or cards. Do not include any additional text or formatting around the components.`;
